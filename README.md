# Offroad-Segmentation-ByteBloom
For this algorithmic problem-solving challenge, Team ByteBloom diagnosed and optimized an underperforming baseline segmentation model. By implementing Weighted Cross-Entropy, strategic data augmentation, and Mixed Precision training, we transformed the provided pipeline to accurately detect critical minority obstacles like logs and bushes.
